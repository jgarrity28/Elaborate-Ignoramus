        alt=""A Firm-y Pair of Socks: Ringworld
        Although admittedly a few books into an impossibly long summer reading list, Ringworld surprised me. A greenhorn science fiction enthusiast, Larry Niven’s 1970 novel was uncharted territory - unknown space. Here’s a TLDR for those who might, understandably so, never have the time to crack open Ringworld:

        Set millennia in the future, the story follow Louis Wu: a ducenti-genarium (200 years old). The invention of FTL allowed humanity to proliferate their arm of the galaxy, and to meet their interstellar neighbors:
        
        Kzinti - 500 lbs of feline skeletal muscle. Descended from plains cats, these fur balls exist purely for war. Their ruling body is the Patriarchy - female kzin are non-sentient (a common yet backwards theme in this story). Humanity bested the kzin in a war of attrition after a hyperspace drive fell into human hands.
        
        Pierson’s Puppeteers - Imagine a three legged horse but instead of a horse its a single furry camel’s hump. Two writhing vipers sprout from its back - its mouths that feature opposable digits and have inordinate amount of sound/voice control. The puppeteers are biologically immortal herd creatures with tech capabilities beyond human comprehension. 
        
        Outriders - We aren’t given much detail about the race, only that their fleets follow starseeds across the galaxy - giant non-sentient aliens that use solar sails to propel themselves about the galaxy. 
        
        Of course there is plenty of additional floral and fauna discovered and recalled by Ringworld’s characters but the above races are the only sentient non-humans species. Louis is approached by a Puppeteer named Nessus to accompany him to a big dumb object in the sky just outside the Milky Way. This of course is the Ringworld, alongside Louis and Puppeteer are Speaker-To-Animals, a kzinti ambassador, and Teela Brown, a human who was quite literally bred into god-dom. 
        
        Although stuffy, especially in the Liar’s cabin, a ship with puppeteer hyperdrive able to cross light years in minutes, and the plot moves so slow you’d think you were in a Slaver status field, I genuinely enjoyed this introduction to alien science fiction. Before this, my only real experiences with sci-fi were: Dune, The Murderbot Diaries, Red Rising saga, and other human-centric universes. No topics were left untouched by the crew’s dialogue - politics, philosophy, evolutionary paths, etc. These interactions formed the more thought provoking elements of my experience. However. . . my favorite alien of them all was the story’s big baddies.
        
        Upon the crews unwelcome arrival, they learned Ringworld had “fallen into barbarism”. The vast majority of the world’s advanced infrastructure was in shambles - but why? Where had the knowledge run off to? Its revealed near the end of the story that Ringworld’s most fearsome alien, was microscopic. The ring was part of a complex trading network on the outskirts of the milky way. Eventually a merchant had brought an invasive mold capable of consuming super-conductors. Take enough planets, enough variety of material, enough species of bacteria, and after enough iterations, normal distribution takes the reigns - and you’re left with a society killing yeast strain that cripples complex societies. 
        
        Not what I was expecting. . . but applicable to our Earth’s current plight. Superbugs are already here. Each year it seems we discover a new anti-biotic resistant strain, until we find a workaround to combat it. Is this the Great Filter? Are all multi-cellular species racing against their single-celled cousins - matter manipulation versus adaptability and quantity. If we truly want to step up on the Kardashev scale, we need to start identifying and treating potential Great Filters like they are - agents capable of stopping humanity in its tracks. 
        
        Thank you for tuning into the first post on Elaborate Ignoramus - more will be sure to follow. Until then. . . there ain’t-no-justice.
        
        Sincerely,
